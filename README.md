## Problem Statement
- Develop a predictive model that assesses the claim probability for car insurance policies. The objective would be to understand the factors that influence claim frequency and severity in the period of six months and enable insurance companies to better assess risk and determine appropriate premiums for policyholders.

## Data
- The dataset contains information related to car insurance policies, including features such as policy tenure, vehicle specifications, ploicy holder age and historical claim data. The target variable is the claim probability, which the model aims to predict for each policy.
- The Dataset is available at https://github.com/Shinde-Siddhant/Car-Insurance-Claim-Predictive-Model/tree/main/Datasets

## Challenges
- This project faced challenges including handling data imbalance and ensuring the interpretability of the predictive model. Strategies were employed to overcome these challenges and deliver a robust and meaningful solution.

## Approach
Our approach involved:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the data's characteristics.
- Feature engineering to enhance the model's predictive capabilities.
- Utilization of machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting etc. for claim probability prediction.
- Model evaluation using relevant performance metrics to ensure accuracy and reliability.

## Results
- The predictive model demonstrated strong performance in assessing claim probability for car insurance policies. 
- Performance metrics such as precision, recall, AUC-ROC were used to evaluate the model's effectiveness. Insights gained from the model contribute to a better understanding of risk factors and aid in premium determination.
